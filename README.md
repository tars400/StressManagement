# StressManagement
Human stress Analysis!

Detecting the level of stress i.e, 1-Highly Stressed/ 2-Moderately Stressed/ 3-Normal by effective use of k-mean clustering
for the dataset of princeton which includes 3014 users surveyed data.

Instructions to use the system

Step 1: Install the “stress management” application in the android supportive device by
	installing the apk file.

Step 2: Run file and install the application in the user’s device(Android compatible Phone with OS 4.0+).

Step 3: Whenever user wants to use the app click the application icon and answer the questions given in the application.

Step 4: This would evaluate the stress level of the user using K-mean clustering and Ecucledian distance algorithm 
	at the back end.

Step 5: The final result is shown to the user and also stored in the database for later review purpose.

Step 6: Along with the group that the user belongs to, the respective relaxation techniques are displayed to practice 
	them to gradually decrease the stress level.

Step 7: For testing use the files under(clusterdata and Importfile). Source_Code for the verfication and kmeansoutput 
	and execute them in the matlab R2014+ under test_stressmanagemnet repository.
